        excerpt: 'Learn how to optimize your resume and job application to ensure you get noticed by both ATS and recruiters in 2024.',
        content: `
            <p>In today's competitive job market, getting past an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) can be a challenge. ATS filters out nearly 75% of resumes before they even reach a human recruiter. This guide will show you how to optimize your resume and job application to ensure you get noticed in 2024.</p>

            <h2>1. Understanding ATS: What It Is and How It Works</h2>
            <p>An ATS is software used by employers to manage job applications. It scans resumes for relevant keywords and formats, filtering out those that don't meet certain criteria.</p>

            <h2>2. Keyword Optimization: The Secret to Passing ATS Filters</h2>
            <p>Identify key skills and phrases from the job description and naturally incorporate them into your resume. Use a mix of exact phrases and related terms.</p>

            <h2>3. Formatting Tips: How to Design an ATS-Friendly Resume</h2>
            <p>Use a clean, simple format with standard headings. Avoid tables, graphics, and unusual fonts that ATS might not be able to read properly.</p>

            <h2>4. Customizing Your Resume: Tailoring Each Application</h2>
            <p>Adjust your resume for each job application, emphasizing the most relevant skills and experiences for that specific role.</p>

            <h2>5. Avoiding Common Pitfalls: What Not to Include in Your Resume</h2>
            <p>Steer clear of headers/footers, images, and non-standard section headings that might confuse the ATS.</p>

            <h2>6. Leveraging LinkedIn: Enhancing Your Digital Footprint</h2>
            <p>Ensure your LinkedIn profile is up-to-date and consistent with your resume. Many ATS now integrate with LinkedIn.</p>

            <h2>7. Following Up: The Importance of Persistence After Submitting</h2>
            <p>Don't rely solely on the ATS. Follow up with human contacts when possible to increase your chances of getting noticed.</p>

            <h3>Don't let your resume get lost in the shuffle!</h3>
